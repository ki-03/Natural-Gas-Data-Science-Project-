# Natural-Gas-Data-Science-Project-
Project Title: Natural Gas Price Estimation and Extrapolation

Description:
This project was completed as part of a J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Analyst simulation. The objective is to estimate the daily purchase price of natural gas using historical monthly price data and extrapolate prices for future dates to support trading and storage decisions. The project focuses on identifying seasonal patterns and trends in natural gas prices to enable accurate pricing of storage contracts.

Problem Context:
Commodity storage contracts allow clients, such as producers, distributors, and trading firms, to store physical commodities and take advantage of seasonal or intra-day price differences. To price these contracts accurately, high-quality granular price data is required. Currently, only monthly snapshots of natural gas prices are available, so the task involves creating a more detailed time series and predicting future prices.

Project Goals:

Analyze historical natural gas price data (October 2020 – September 2024).

Identify seasonal trends and patterns affecting prices.

Extrapolate prices one year into the future for longer-term storage contract evaluation.

Implement a Python program that takes any date as input and returns an estimated gas price.

Visualize the data to support insights and decisions.

Technologies & Tools:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)

Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib)

Time series analysis and interpolation techniques

Outcome:
A Python-based tool capable of estimating daily natural gas prices from historical data and projecting future prices, helping trading teams make informed decisions for storage contracts.
